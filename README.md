[Pokole](https://github.com/alexthemaster/pokole)'s built in web interface

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

This codebase started as a fully human-written Vue 2 project and was later migrated to Vue 3 with help from AI agents in **Google Antigravity** (an AI-powered IDE). The migration and most subsequent development was "vibe coded" - iterative development with flexible planning, adapting and improving as needed. This approach was taken because I'm not particularly skilled at nor do I enjoy frontend development.
